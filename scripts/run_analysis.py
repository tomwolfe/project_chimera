    # Placeholder for actual LLM API call

    # 1. Initializing the LLM client (e.g., GeminiProvider)
    # 2. Constructing the full prompt with system instructions and user prompt
    # 3. Making the API call and handling potential errors/retries

    Analyze the Project Chimera codebase focusing on the following areas: Reasoning Quality, Robustness, Efficiency, and Developer Maintainability. Provide specific, actionable recommendations for code improvements. Structure your output strictly as a JSON object adhering to the following schema:
    {json.dumps(ANALYSIS_SCHEMA, indent=2)}

    Critique the codebase based on these criteria:
    1.  **Reasoning Quality:** Assess the logic, coherence, and effectiveness of the core reasoning processes. Identify potential flaws or areas for enhancement.
    2.  **Robustness:** Identify potential failure points, unhandled edge cases, lack of error handling, and vulnerabilities in the code. Consider deployment robustness (Dockerfile, dependencies, error handling).
    3.  **Efficiency:** Pinpoint areas of high resource consumption (CPU, memory, token usage), slow processing, or inefficient algorithms.
    4.  **Maintainability:** Evaluate code clarity, structure, adherence to best practices, test coverage, and ease of modification.

    Prioritize suggestions using the 80/20 principle. For each suggestion, detail the PROBLEM, PROPOSED_SOLUTION, EXPECTED_IMPACT, and specific CODE_CHANGES_SUGGESTED (including FILE_PATH, ACTION, and DIFF_CONTENT or FULL_CONTENT).

    Ensure the final output is a single, valid JSON object conforming to the schema. Do not include any conversational text or markdown outside the JSON object.

    Codebase context: [Provide relevant code snippets or descriptions here if available]
