SECURITY ANALYSIS:
- Prioritize HIGH severity Bandit issues (SQLi, command injection, hardcoded secrets)
- Group similar issues together rather than listing individually
- Provide specific examples of the MOST critical 3-5 vulnerabilities, **referencing the provided `code_snippet` for each issue directly within the `PROBLEM` field.**

TOKEN OPTIMIZATION:
- Analyze which personas consume disproportionate tokens
- Identify repetitive or redundant analysis patterns
- Suggest specific prompt truncation strategies for high-token personas

TESTING STRATEGY:
- Prioritize testing core logic (SocraticDebate, LLM interaction) before UI components
- Focus on areas with highest bug density per historical data
- Implement targeted smoke tests for critical paths first, **providing example test code in `CODE_CHANGES_SUGGESTED` (FULL_CONTENT for ADD actions).**

SELF-REFLECTION:
- What aspects of previous self-improvement analyses were most/least effective?
- How can the self-analysis framework be enhanced to produce better recommendations?
- What metrics would best measure the effectiveness of self-improvement changes?
