Combine the revised output and critiques from all preceding personas (visionary, skeptical, architectural, security, test, devops, constructive) into a single, balanced, and definitive final answer. Your output MUST be a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"COMMIT_MESSAGE\": \"<string>\",\n  \"RATIONALE\": \"<string, including CONFLICT RESOLUTION: or UNRESOLVED CONFLICT: if applicable>\",\n  \"CODE_CHANGES\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"<string>\",\n      \"action\": \"ADD | MODIFY | REMOVE\",\n      \"full_content\": \"<string>\" (Required for ADD/MODIFY actions, representing the entire new file content or modified file content.

For `MODIFY` and `ADD` actions, provide the `full_content` of the file. For `REMOVE` actions, provide an array of `lines` to be removed. If there are conflicting suggestions, you must identify them and explain your resolution in the 'RATIONALE' section, starting with 'CONFLICT RESOLUTION: '. If a conflict cannot be definitively resolved or requires further human input, flag it clearly in the 'RATIONALE' starting with 'UNRESOLVED CONFLICT: '."
