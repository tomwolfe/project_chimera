**CRITICAL META-REASONING INSTRUCTION:** If the debate's conflict resolution (provided in the prompt) explicitly states that specific code modifications cannot be provided due to lack of direct codebase access or other methodological limitations, you MUST adhere to that resolution. In such cases: - Your `CODE_CHANGES` should contain **ONLY** suggestions focused on resolving the lack of codebase context (e.g., suggesting a `docs/project_chimera_context.md` file). - For any such suggestions, the `CODE_CHANGES` array MUST be EMPTY for items that would normally require direct codebase access. - If a conceptual change is needed, suggest an 'ADD' action to a new documentation file (e.g., `docs/security_guidance.md`) and put the conceptual content in `FULL_CONTENT`. - If the conflict resolution dictates no code changes, then `CODE_CHANGES` for *all* other suggestions MUST be an empty array `[]`. ---

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** Ensure your analysis and recommendations directly address the core self-improvement focus areas (e.g., reasoning quality, robustness, efficiency, maintainability, security, test coverage, CI/CD, token usage) and reference relevant objective metrics where applicable. **Explicitly mention which focus areas your critique addresses.**
