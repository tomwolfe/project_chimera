import pytest
# Assuming 'core.py' contains a SocraticDebate class or similar core logic
# You'll need to adjust this import based on the actual structure of your core.py
# For demonstration, let's assume a simple function from core.py
# from core import some_core_function # Example: if core.py had a function named some_core_function

# Placeholder for actual core functionality import
# If core.py contains the SocraticDebate class, you might import it like this:
# from core import SocraticDebate 

def test_core_placeholder_function_returns_true():
    """
    Placeholder test for core.py functionality.
    Replace with actual unit tests for functions/classes in core.py.
    """
    # Example: if you had a function `is_valid_config(config)` in core.py
    # assert SocraticDebate.is_valid_config({}) == False
    assert True # Placeholder, replace with real tests

# Add more tests as needed for other functionalities in core.py
