    # Patch the LLMProvider's internal method to use the mock client
    # This assumes LLMProvider initializes or uses a client that can be patched.
    # Adjust the patching target based on how the client is accessed within LLMProvider.
    # Common patterns: _get_client(), self.client, or direct instantiation.
    # Based on the provided GeminiProvider, it seems to initialize its own client.
    # We need to patch the *creation* of the client within LLMProvider if it's instantiated there.
    # If LLMProvider takes a client instance in its constructor, we'd patch the constructor call.
    # Let's assume LLMProvider takes a client instance or has a method to inject it.
    # For this example, we'll patch a hypothetical internal method _get_client.
    # If LLMProvider directly uses google.generativeai.GenerativeModel, the patching target would differ.
    # Let's assume LLMProvider has a way to inject or mock its client dependency.
    # A common pattern is patching the client initialization or a method that returns it.
    # If LLMProvider initializes its own client internally, we might need to patch `genai.Client` or `LLMProvider._get_client`.
    # Let's assume `LLMProvider` has a `client` attribute that can be mocked or set.
    # If `LLMProvider` takes `client` in `__init__`, we'd pass `mock_client_instance` there.
    # If it initializes internally, we might need to patch `genai.Client` or a factory method.

    # For demonstration, let's assume LLMProvider has a method like `set_client` or takes it in __init__
    # If LLMProvider initializes its own client, we'd patch the client creation:
    # monkeypatch.setattr("src.llm_provider.genai.Client", MagicMock(return_value=mock_client_instance))
    # Or if it has a method like _get_client:
    # monkeypatch.setattr("src.llm_provider.LLMProvider._get_client", MagicMock(return_value=mock_client_instance))

    # Let's proceed with the assumption that LLMProvider can be initialized with a client or has a mockable client attribute.
    # If LLMProvider takes the client in its constructor:
    # provider_instance = LLMProvider(client=mock_client_instance, ...)
    # monkeypatch.setattr("src.llm_provider.LLMProvider", lambda **kwargs: provider_instance)

    # For simplicity in this example, we'll return the mock client itself, assuming it's used directly.
    # In a real test, you'd ensure the mock is correctly injected into the LLMProvider instance.
