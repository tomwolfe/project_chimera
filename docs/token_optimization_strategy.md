# Token Optimization Strategy

## Objective

To reduce the overall token consumption of the Project Chimera system while maintaining or improving the quality of analysis and output. This involves both improving the accuracy of token tracking and optimizing the prompts used by various personas.

## Current State Analysis

- **High Token Usage:** Personas such as Code_Architect, Security_Auditor, and Self_Improvement_Analyst exhibit high token usage per turn (averaging 4861.0 tokens across all turns).
- **Tracking Discrepancy:** Initial metrics show `total_tokens: 0`, which contradicts the per-persona usage data, indicating a potential issue with the aggregation or reporting mechanism.

## Recommendations

### 1. Enhance Token Tracking Accuracy

- **Review Aggregation Logic:** Examine the code responsible for collecting and summing token counts from individual persona interactions. Ensure that all LLM calls are captured and that the counts are correctly aggregated into the `token_usage_stats`.
- **Implement Granular Logging:** Log token usage per LLM call, including prompt tokens and completion tokens, for detailed debugging and analysis.
- **Validate Reporting:** Cross-reference logged token counts with API usage reports (if available) to ensure accuracy.

### 2. Optimize Prompts for High-Token Personas

#### a) Code_Architect (4508 tokens/turn)

- **Focus on Specificity:** Instead of providing the entire codebase context, provide only the relevant sections or files pertinent to the current architectural task.
- **Structured Input:** Use structured formats (e.g., JSON, YAML) for inputting code snippets or architectural diagrams, which can be more token-efficient than natural language descriptions.
- **Task Decomposition:** Break down complex architectural tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks, each with a focused prompt.

#### b) Security_Auditor (4383 tokens/turn)

- **Targeted Scanning:** If possible, guide the Security Auditor to focus on specific modules or code areas known to be higher risk, rather than scanning the entire codebase repeatedly.
- **Pre-computation/Caching:** For common security patterns or known vulnerabilities, consider pre-computing checks or using cached results where applicable.
- **Contextual Security Prompts:** Frame security analysis prompts with specific security goals or threat models in mind.

#### c) Self_Improvement_Analyst (3912 tokens/turn)

- **Meta-Analysis Focus:** When analyzing the self-improvement process itself, focus prompts on the *methodology* and *principles* rather than attempting to re-analyze the entire codebase context unless strictly necessary.
- **Leverage Previous Outputs:** Utilize summaries and key findings from previous analysis turns to avoid redundant information processing.
- **Define Clear Objectives:** Ensure each analysis turn has a clearly defined objective, guiding the persona to provide concise and relevant feedback.

### 3. General Prompt Engineering Best Practices

- **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously test and refine prompts based on observed token usage and output quality.
- **Prompt Templating:** Utilize prompt templates to ensure consistency and allow for easier modification.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Experiment with LLM parameters (e.g., `temperature`, `max_tokens`) that might influence prompt length and output verbosity.

## Measurement of Success

- Reduction in average tokens per turn for key personas.
- Improved accuracy and completeness of `token_usage_stats`.
- Qualitative assessment of output quality remains high or improves.
- Reduction in overall API costs.
