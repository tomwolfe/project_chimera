# Persona Alignment and Schema Adherence Guidelines

## Objective

To ensure that all AI personas within Project Chimera consistently produce outputs that adhere to predefined JSON schemas and maintain contextual relevance, thereby improving the overall reasoning quality and reliability of the system.

## Current Challenges

- **Schema Validation Failures:** Metrics indicate instances where persona outputs do not conform to the expected JSON structure.
- **Content Misalignment:** Warnings suggest that the content of persona outputs sometimes deviates from the intended meaning or context.
- **Persona-Specific Issues:** The `Devils_Advocate` persona exhibits a 0.0 success rate, indicating a potential fundamental issue with its operational logic or prompt.

## Strategies for Improvement

### 1. Schema Design and Validation

- **Comprehensive Schemas:** Develop detailed and accurate JSON schemas for each persona's output. These schemas should clearly define data types, required fields, and acceptable value ranges.
- **Flexible Validation:** While strict adherence is desired, consider implementing validation logic that allows for minor, non-critical deviations (e.g., extra, non-essential fields) if they do not impact downstream processing. Libraries like `pydantic` can be leveraged for robust data validation and parsing.
- **Error Reporting:** Ensure that schema validation failures provide clear, actionable error messages indicating the specific field, expected type, and received value.

### 2. Prompt Engineering for Alignment

- **Explicit Formatting Instructions:** Include explicit instructions within persona prompts regarding the required output format (e.g., "Your output MUST be a valid JSON object conforming to the following schema: ...").
- **Contextual Reinforcement:** Reiterate the persona's role and the specific task context within the prompt to guide the LLM's response generation.
- **Example-Based Guidance (Few-Shot Learning):** Provide one or two examples of correctly formatted and contextually aligned outputs within the prompt. This is particularly effective for complex or nuanced requirements.
- **Negative Constraints:** Clearly state what should *not* be included in the output (e.g., "Do not include conversational filler.", "Avoid generating explanations outside the specified JSON structure.").

### 3. Addressing Persona-Specific Issues (e.g., Devils_Advocate)

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate the specific reasons for the `Devils_Advocate` persona's low success rate. This may involve:
    - Reviewing its core logic and prompt.
    - Testing its responses with simplified inputs.
    - Ensuring its objective is clearly defined and achievable within the LLM's capabilities.
- **Iterative Prompt Refinement:** Based on the analysis, refine the `Devils_Advocate`'s prompt to clarify its role, expected output, and the critical counter-arguments it should provide.

### 4. Integrating Feedback into the Loop

- **Automated Feedback:** Configure the system to automatically capture schema validation failures and content misalignment warnings.
- **Self-Correction Mechanism:** Feed these captured issues back into the self-improvement process. This could involve:
    - Triggering a re-analysis of the problematic output with a refined prompt.
    - Prioritizing prompt adjustments for personas that consistently fail validation.
    - Creating specific test cases to address recurring alignment issues.

## Expected Outcomes

- Reduced `schema_validation_failures_count` and `content_misalignment_warnings`.
- Improved `success_rate` for all personas, particularly those currently underperforming.
- More reliable and consistent data for downstream analysis and decision-making.
